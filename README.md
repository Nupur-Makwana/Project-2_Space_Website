# ðŸš€ Space Exploration - Single Page Website

This is a single-page space-themed website designed and built by **me**. It includes sections like a hero banner, planet cards, a timeline of space missions, a styled image grid, and a responsive footer. Although some links and buttons are visually clickable, they do not redirectâ€”this site is purely for visual design and layout practice.
