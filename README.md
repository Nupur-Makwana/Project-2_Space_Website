# 🚀 Space Exploration - Single Page Website

This is a single-page space-themed website designed and built by **me**. It includes sections like a hero banner, planet cards, a timeline of space missions, a styled image grid, and a responsive footer. Although some links and buttons are visually clickable, they do not redirect—this site is purely for visual design and layout practice.

 Beautiful hero section with a space background
 Planet cards (static, not linked)
 Timeline of iconic space missions
 Image grid layout
 Responsive footer with email input & social icons

 Technology Used

Responsiveness

The website adapts across devices:

 Image grid maintains structure and aesthetics

 All interactions are **non-functional** for now.
 There is only **one homepage** — no routing or additional pages.
